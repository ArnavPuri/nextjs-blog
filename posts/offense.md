"Doing things you love make it easy to do things."

It's tough to choose a path

When you don't listen to your heart

With all the noise around 

Sometime that voice can't be found

What should we do in such a case?

Should we just pick one and be fearless

Or should we wait, wait for a guide

Who might never give us a ride

No, you just can't wait at a place for long

Because life is a beautiful song

And if the song is paused, it can't be enjoyed

Also to truly listen, noises you must avoid

Maybe looking back, all confusion will make sense

Till then let's live the life on offense
